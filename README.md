## Scala 3 with Spring Boot?

I must be mad, but, someone tried to convince me it was worth it.

Well, it took a morning, but I got a rest end point up with a JPA reading from
postgres, and its, well, really a nothing.  ie if you do this it pulls you back 
from fs2, doobie, monads and you are swimming in the imperative annotation sea again.
May as well code in Java and ... why would you do that?
